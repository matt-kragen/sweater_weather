## Overview

*Sweater Weather* is a Rails API that provides the information necessary to build a front-end application with access to MapQuest routing features and OpenWeather forecasts associated with potential road trips.

## Learning Goals

This project was intended as an exercise to practice:
- Exposing an API
- Aggregating and exposing data from external APIs
- API-based CRUD functionality
- API key generation; token-based authentication
- Building endpoints based on front end wireframes

## Features

Upon registration with an email address, users are provided with a unique API key. This key can then be used to plan a road trip through MapQuest's Route service, combined with OpenWeather's Onecall service to view predicted weather at their selected destination.

In addition, this app allows for:
- Keyword-based forecast searches by location using MapQuest's Geocode service
- Keyword-based background image searches using Pexels's Image service
- Session creation with user authentication
- API-key authentication
- Custom error-handling messages to control for sad paths/edge cases

## API Endpoints

| Feature                        | Endpoint                                       |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Retrieve forecast for location | `GET  /api/v1/forecast?location={location}`    |
| Retrieve background image      | `GET  /api/v1/backgrounds?location={location}` |
| Create User                    | `POST /api/v1/users`                           |
| Login User                     | `POST /api/v1/sessions`                        |
| Create new Road Trip           | `POST /api/v1/road_trip`                       |

## Usage Examples

JSON Body:
```json
{
    "origin": "Vista, CA",
    "destination": "Denver, CO",
    "api_key": "[KEY]"
}
```
